--> Create an array of objects (empArray) of type as shown below:
    empArray: { ID: number, 
        FirstName: string, 
        LastName: string, 
        Address: {FlatNo: number, Society: string, City: string, State: string}, 
        Salary: number }[]

--> Print empArray in the terminal using console.log

--> Inoreder to perform Searching by Index No. we need a searchIndex variable which stores the index no. which is to be searched.
    Also a for loop that loops over the entire array and finds the matched index no. and corresponding employee data.

--> Inoreder to perform Searching by Employee ID. we need a searchID variable which stores the employee ID which is to be searched.
    Also a for loop that loops over the entire array and finds the matched employee ID and corresponding employee data.

--> Insert the employee can be performed using .push() array method
    It adds the item at the end of the array.

--> Delete the employee can be performed using .shift() array method
    It deletes the 1st array item.

--> Array Concatenation can be performed using .concat() array method
    It merges/concatenates the new array at the end of old array and returns the updated array.

--> Display Array List can be performed using for loop and template string.
