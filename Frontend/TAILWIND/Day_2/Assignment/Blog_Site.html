City is Located on the banks of the River Sabarmati. The city is the administrative centre of Ahmedabad district, and was the capital of Gujarat from 1960 to 1970; the capital was shifted to Gandhinagar thereafter. The city was at the forefront of the Indian independence movement in the first half of 20th century. It was the epicentre of many campaigns of civil disobedience to promote workers’ right, civil rights and political independence. Mahatma Gandhi also established Gandhi Ashram on the bank of river Sabarmati and selected Ahmedabad as his “Karmabhumi”.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The city was founded in 1411 to serve as the capital of the Sultanate of Gujarat, by its namesake, Sultan Ahmed Shah.

                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Ahmedabad remained the most important city in the Gujarat region. The City established itself as the home of a booming textile industry, which earned the nickname “The Manchester of India.” With the creation of the state of Gujarat in 1960, Ahmedabad gained prominence as the political and commercial capital of the state. Once characterized by dusty roads and congested localities, the city is witnessing a major construction boom and population increase. A rising centre of education, information technology and scientific industries, Ahmedabad remains the cultural and commercial heart of Gujarat, and much of western India. Since 2000, the city has been transformed through the construction of skyscrapers, shopping malls and multiplexes.</p>

They have left the best of architects and pioneering design engineers intrigued and in unresolvable wonder. What they cannot unravel is when one minaret is shaken the other begins to vibrate, though the connecting passage between the two remains vibration-free; what causes this vibration is unknown. There are two well-known pairs of Shaking Minarets in Ahmedabad, one located opposite the Sarangpur Darwaja and the other near the Kalupur Railway Station Area. </p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The one near Sarangpur Darwaja is within the vicinity of the Sidi Bashir Mosque built in 1452 AD by Sidi Bashir, a slave of Sultan Ahmed Shah. They are three storeys tall with carved balconies where visitors were once allowed to climb all the way up. The other set of minarets near the Railway Station is taller in height. However, these are not in a very good condition as it is believed that the British had dismantled them to understand the cause of vibrations. They could not resolve the engineering and it was not possible to put them back in their original condition. Demonstrations of the minarets shaking or vibrating are not carried out anymore.</p>

It is said to be the second largest lake in the city. Multiple tourist spots like the zoo, kids city, toy-train, hot-air balloon ride, water-based rides and other such entertainment attractions are in abundance in the lakefront that has been developed around Kankaria lake. However, it wasn’t like this since the beginning.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Recently there was reconstruction and reworking of the lakefront, by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). In the past, due to negligence, Kankaria lake dried up and became dirty thereby rendering it useless, but with the joint efforts of AMC and the government, it is now a revamped place that is a major tourist attraction. Various kinds of social, cultural and similar activities take place here.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The construction of the lake was done by some of the finest Mughal architects of the time as evident from the different cuttings and designs in the stones that have been employed to construct the polygonal shaped reservoir that resides right in the middle of this lake.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Kankaria lake consists of an island that encompasses Nagina Wadi, which is a garden, right in the middle of it. This place in itself is a beautiful tourist spot here. Nagina means jewel here. The garden further consists of a summer palace which goes by the name of Ghattamandal.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">A bridge connects with the bank that was originally 48 arches long. Many have mentioned this kind of architecture as a magnificent piece of the Mughal era, and just like a centre piece in jewellery, it is also known as the centre jewel of the lake.</p>

                <div class=""><img src="../../../Assets/Blog_Site/a7.jpeg" alt="a7" class="mx-auto border-2 border-slate-300 rounded-lg  shadow-2xl shadow-yellow-500" style="height: 400px;"></div>

                    <p class="indent-6 py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Adalaj Stepwell or Rudabai Stepwell is a stepwell located in the village of Adalaj, close to Gandhinagar city in Gandhinagar district in the Indian state of Gujarat, and considered a fine example of Indian architecture work. It was built in 1498 in the memory of Rana Veer Singh by his wife, Queen Rudadevi.The stepwell was built by Mahmud Begada in 1411, to commemorate Queen Rudabai, wife of Veersinh, the Vaghela chieftain. It served both a utilitarian and spiritual purpose for the people around. A number of people from villages around once filled water from this stepwell.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The flamboyant 15th-century stepwell, has lost only little of its grandeur over the last few centuries. Till date, the intricate carvings on the pillars that support the five storeys are mostly intact; the beams work as pit stops for pigeons flying in and out and the structure still leaves jaws dropped for swarms of people. The step-well represents the Indo-Islamic fusion architecture that percolated through the many stepwells of the period. There are some fascinating features of the vav that make this an important emblem of superior architecture. The opening in the ceilings above the landing allows light and air to enter the octagonal well, but direct sunlight never touches the steps except at noon. It is said that the temperature inside the well is six degrees cooler than outside. </p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The stepwell has three entrances. The stairs lead to an underground storey, which has an octagonal opening on top. The walls are covered in ornamental carvings with mythological and village scenes. Some of them include Ami khumbor (a pot that contains the water of life) and the Kalp vriksha (a tree of life) carved out of a single slab of stone. There is a belief that the small frieze of Navagraha (nine-planets) towards the edge of the well protects the monument from bad omens.</p>

                    <p class="indent-6 py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The lanes of old Ahmedabad are having a very organized habitat design called pols. Pol houses are considered as primary housing typology built for more than three hundred years in the old city of Ahmedabad. Ahmadabad has a rich heritage of settlement patterns in its historic old town, the communal riot and the civil disorder of 18th century lead to the construction of pol houses which were organized in dense clusters consisting of two ends which have a single gateway. The residents of each cluster always belong to the same religion not only same religion but also to the same caste, family or same occupation.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">So a pol is a combination of many multistory individual houses which form a neighborhood which has their own urban structure which is self-sufficient for the communities.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The most attractive and eye-catchy fact about pol houses are its exquisitely, lavishly and intricately carved wooden panels which are adorning the entrance, wooden pillars, brackets etc. The detailing of each piece of art is exceptional at the same time confusing in its identity. At one glance all appear same but there are very little slight differences in each figure. The artistry of each piece will give an observer an awestruck, which can easily take to that era and will force to think that how much time must have spent on each piece to get this perfection, the patient level of those artisans and the impeccable and unimpeachable artistry.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">In huge houses where there are lot many intricate ornamentations, a keen observer can sometimes see some unfinished carvings, that can easily lead the thought process to another level. what must have been the reason the artist left it incomplete? One another question what comes to mind will be, how did these carvings are so much similar? It is astonishing that even after these many years, these wood carvings are still alive and young. The changes of sun and moon, the breezy winter and freezing cold nights, the steamy and dusty summer days; nothing, absolutely nothing could ruin them. </p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Even after these many years, there are havelis which are absolutely abandoned and still in good condition. The architectural style of these havelis is clearly showing an amalgamation of Mughal-Maratha influence. The intricately carved flora and fauna, mythical characters like yali, the parrots and peacocks, human figures, all these are creating a royal extravaganza to the visitors.</p>

                    <p class="indent-6 py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">In May 1997, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation launched a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - the Sabarmati 
                        Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) under Section 149(3) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956.
                        The project aims to provide Ahmedabad with a meaningful waterfront environment along the banks of the Sabarmati 
                        River and to redefine an identity of Ahmedabad around the river. The project has reconnected the city with the river 
                        and has positively transformed the neglected aspects of the riverfront.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Sabarmati Riverfront is a waterfront being developed along the banks of Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, India. Proposed in the 
                        1960s, the construction began in 2005. Since 2012, the waterfront is gradually opened to public as and when facilities are 
                        constructed and various facilities are actively under construction.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">Urban forestry is the new thrust area to increase the green cover in the city and enhance the livability in the neighbourhoods and to provide the City with

                        Riverfront has increased the Green cover of the City and consists of variety of native, fruit bearing Trees and also has many endangered species of Trees.

                    <p class="indent-6 py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, popularly known as Sidi Saiyyid ni Jali locally, built in 1572-73 AD, is one of the most famous mosques of Ahmedabad, a city in the state of Gujarat, India. </p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The mosque is entirely arcuated and is known for its ten intricately carved stone latticework windows (jalis) on the side and rear arches. The rear wall is filled with square stone pierced panels in geometrical designs. The two bays flanking the central aisle have reticulated stone slabs carved in designs of intertwined trees and foliage and a palm motif. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.</p>
                    <p class="py-6 px-12 text-lg text-justify">The central window arch of the mosque, where one would expect to see another intricate jali, is instead walled with stone. This is possibly because the mosque was not completed according to plan before the Mughals invaded Gujarat.</p>
